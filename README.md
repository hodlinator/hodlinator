***Bitcoin's success is NOT inevitable.*** We have to be the change we want to see.

Time available to me is dedicated to improving Bitcoin Core for internal/external developers and users.

The Node is the main feature I value in Bitcoin Core, but also respect the Descriptor/Miniscript parts. Would like to see Wallet machine code instructions separated from the Node, but I'm intrigued by the lack of BIP39 support. Still have a lot to learn.
