# 2025 February-April

## `HeadersSync` cache/improvements

* Opened PR against other contributor's fork and got initial feedback.
* Reviewed older PRs for clues as to why a cache was not previously included.
* Next step will be to ask OG dev(s) about the subject.

## CI/Windows/functional tests

ðŸŒŸ <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31410#pullrequestreview-2604068753>

* Managed to uncover & propose fix for minor wallet/filesystem interaction bug (should probably create PR).
* Re-implemented Windows-native permission checking using ACLs instead of chmod.
* Found issue with cross-built version of the PR.

ðŸŒŸ Diagnosed issue with C++ evaluation order causing fuzz-test to fail on Windows: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32135#issuecomment-2751723855>

...admitted the original code was suggested by me (<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32135#issuecomment-2752374109>).

ðŸŒŸ Diagnosed and fixed TxIndex race-condition leading to rare test failures:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32010>

Implemented Windows-support for test (ðŸ”« one-shot merge):
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32021>

Spent time learning more about CI environment in order to review:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31176#pullrequestreview-2611426260>

Further improvements to my error reporting robustness PR:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30660#issuecomment-2819614471>

## Net

Reviewed uPnP migration code:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31916#pullrequestreview-2641238999>

Prompted long-time contributor to come up with edge-cases for code one level removed from code under review:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32166#discussion_r2021101693>

Got positive feedback for my alternative branch to a PR under review:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32015#issuecomment-2770068984>
Argued against introducing `shared_ptr` usage in part of code:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32015#discussion_r2049571166>
Published second update of alternative implementation:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32015#issuecomment-2809672862>
Still interested to see what comes out of version based on in-depth domain knowledge (<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32015#issuecomment-2828630396>). Hope to be able to find an approach that avoids `shared_ptr` usage.

## Test/fuzz determinism

Created hacky patch to make determinism test tool pass and prove usefulness:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31901#pullrequestreview-2637311191>

ðŸŒŸ Inspired better Rust usage <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31901#discussion_r1996678675> -> <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32074>.
There, I inspired parallelizing the Rust logic <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32074#discussion_r2001916136> which lead to a major part of <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32158>. Further collaboration on Rust parallelism here:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32158#discussion_r2020911351>

## IBD optimizations

ðŸŒŸ "Excellent" find of conflict between file descriptors:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31551#discussion_r2027816889>

Continued review of multi-byte block obfuscation optimization:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31144#pullrequestreview-2788618744>

## Testing guide feedback

## Consensus

Suggested further optimization on consensus code:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31682/files#r1992337395>

Spawned idea that led to â‚¿OSS student asking about having the timelock be block height+100 since coinbase outputs are unspendable until 100 blocks, to simplify logic. Unfortunately it was not a fully researched thought:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32155#discussion_r2019460884>

## (Taxes)

Spent some time and gray hairs on getting the accounting sorted so I can officially receive a fully taxed Bitcoin-salary.

## (IRC)

Configured a [promising setup](../guides/IRC_config/) to increase my participation on IRC.

## (Social corner)

Didn't make it to latest CoreDev, am fully committed to go to the next one. Started having both a couple of recurring and a few on-demand video chats with devs outside of the usual meetings.

Started participating in [Waye OS Reboot](https://www.waye.dev/initiatives/os-reboot#bitcoin), thanks to [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/) for paying them!
